    <p>Raiden (雷電?), real name Jack, also known as Jack the Ripper, White Devil, and Snake, was a Liberian-American mercenary and former special forces soldier. Previously a child soldier under Solidus Snake, Raiden was later selected by the Patriots to test the S3 Plan at the Big Shell, as a new recruit to the reformed FOXHOUND unit. He later worked alongside the Paradise Lost Army in their anti-Patriot activities, but was captured and forced to undergo 
        heavy cybernetic experimentation. After successfully escaping, Raiden went on to assist Solid Snake during the Guns of the Patriots Incident.
        In 2018, Raiden became a member of Maverick Security Consulting, Inc., doing multiple tasks while raising money for his family. However, during an escort mission in Africa they were attacked by Desperado Enforcement LLC., who killed Raiden's protectee, N'mani, and left Raiden for dead. Fortunately he was saved by the 
        scientist Wilhelm Voigt and worked with Maverick to fight Desperado. Raiden's vengeful obsession with Desperado became personal when he discovered during a mission in Mexico that Desperado and World Marshal Inc. had kidnapped several children, surgically removed their brains to place into cybernetic bodies, and were planning to subject them to VR training modeled after his own. 
        Raiden then resigned from Maverick to pursue and retrieve the children's brain cases from World Marshal in Colorado.</p>
